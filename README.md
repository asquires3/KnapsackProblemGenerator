# KnapsackProblemGenerator
Create problems for a knapsack problem solver to solve. Meant for CSI2120
All the variables can be found at the top, they all have descriptions of what they do
I have barely tested this at all, just wanted to help out a bit, if there are any bugs/issues lmk on the discord server @DistantGhost#8748
If you want to change the path, remember to double backslash (\\\\). There is NOTHING in this repository that is related to actually solving the Knapsack problem, just a generator for more problems. Example folder contains examples as well as the correct solution for the dynamic table.
